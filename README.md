# Knowledge-Hub
## Inspiration
Nowadays the resources are very huge know that we could not be able to fetch what is better for us and getting stuck at tutorials without the proper guidance of an experience one and thus procrastinating the tasks. 

## What it does
- Knowledge Hub is a platform where users not only can find the best resources to learn a 
skill instead there will be a roadmap which they can adjust according to level, and timings and they will be reminded by emails to keep track of the roadmaps. 
- To keep everyone on track and involved in learning, everyone can track not only their progress instead they can compete with others(friends) and learn quickly.
- There will be an assistive chatbot that will be helping the newbies in finding out their desired course. 
- Open community links will be provided like discord and telegram channels where users can discuss and know lot more things from them. 
- The main theme of this platform is to keep learners engaged in learning without just showing them boring stuff. Everyone must know how interesting learning would be in communities. 

## How we built it
- Considering the time provided for the hackathon our team has worked on the fronted part and login page for the users using HTML, CSS, PHP, and MySQL. 

## Challenges we ran into
- Gaining the trust of users and providing them the best resources to learn the skill and getting 
the reviews of users who are already skilled in it. 
- Gathering the resources and updating from time to time. 
#### Overcoming the Challenges
- The platform can be made open source where users can make pull request of the old resources by modifying them into new.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
- As per our goals and the targets, we have completed the frontend part and also added some resources so that the website can be used up to some extent. And we are more excited to complete the dashboard for users.

## What we learned
- It is a very nice experience to work in this Hackathon with my team, and we are thankful to Devpost for this opportunity, We improved our skills in Backend, as it was challenging for us to make a login page for users in PHP, but we learned it.

## What's next for the Knowledge hub
- As mentioned, the theme is to get users engaged and not to make them feel bored with the facilities. 
- Based on the reviews this can be turned out into a start-up combining mentorship in this platform.
